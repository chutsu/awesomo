## Dependencies

    cd <your catkin workspace>/src
    git clone https://github.com/wavelab/atl
    cd atl/scripts/install
    sudo bash install_deps.bash

This will install all depencies required by ATL.


## Install

The following instructions assumes you have installed ROS.

    cd <your catkin workspace>/src
    git clone https://github.com/wavelab/atl
    cd ..
    catkin build

In short the above navigates to your catkin workspace's `src`, clones `atl`
and finally runs `catkin_make` to build the project, tests and installs configs
and launch files.


## Run Gazebo Simulations

ATL uses Gazebo simulation to test the control and perception, to launch an
instance of a Gazebo simulation along with ATL enter the following commands:

    # Environment variables to tell Gazebo where to look for 3D models and plugins
    # The following assumes you're using `catkin build` instead of `catkin make`
    export GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=${GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH}:$HOME/.gazebo
    export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=${GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH}:$HOME/.gazebo/models
    export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}:$HOME/.gazebo/plugins

    # Launch Gazebo simulation
    roslaunch atl_ros atl_sim.launch
